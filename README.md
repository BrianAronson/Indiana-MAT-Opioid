This repository was written in 2019. It uses the Washington Posts' version of the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) (titled by WaPo: "The DEA Database"), the American Community Survey, and a private insurance dataset to track the relationship between opioid pill supply and use of medical assisted therapies (MAT) in treating opioid addiction across Indiana.
